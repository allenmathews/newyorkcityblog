                <p>New York is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue
                    of liberty, which is currently located on Ellis island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn't unvieled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly
                    known for big buildings, Broadway shows, adn bright neon signs. This famous location was named after the New York Times after Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for
                    its bridges that connect thr boroughs and allow ease of transportation.</p>
